# x64

## Todo:

* "There are odd limitations accessing the byte registers due to coding issues
  in the REX opcode prefix used for the new registers: an instruction cannot
  reference a legacy high byte (AH, BH, CH, DH) and one of the new byte
  registers at the same time (such as R11B), but it can use legacy low bytes
  (AL, BL, CL, DL). This is enforced by changing (AH, BH, CH, DH) to (BPL, SPL,
  DIL, SIL) for instructions using a REX prefix."?
* "shadow space" in calling conventions?


x64 is a generic name for the 64-bit extensions to Intel's and AMD's 32-bit x86
instruction set architecture (ISA). AMD introduced the first version of x64,
initially called x86-64 and later renamed AMD64. Intel named their
implementation IA-32e and then EMT64.

There are some slight incompatibilities between the two versions, but most code works fine on both; we call this intersection flavour x64.

Not to be confused with the 64-bit Intel Itanium architecture, which is called
IA-64.

## Byte order

Intel is little endian: lower significant bytes in lower memory addresses.


## Registers

16 general purpose 64-bit registers (GPRs):

First 8: RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX, RBP, RSI, RDI, RSP.

Replace the initial R with E to access the lower 32 bits (e.g. EAX for RAX).
Remove the initial R to access the lower 16 bits (e.g. AX for RAX).
Change the X to L to access the lower byte (e.g. AL for AX), and to H for the
high byte (e.g. AH for AX).

Second 8: R8 to R15.

Access as R8 (qword), R8D (lower dword), R8W (lowest word), R8B (lowest byte
MASM style, Intel style R8L). There is no R8H.

The 64-bit instruction pointer RIP points to the next instruction to be
executed, and supports a 64-bit flat memory model.

The stack pointer RSP points to the last item pushed onto the stack, which
grows towards lower addresses.

The RFLAGS register stores flags used for results of operations and for
controlling the processor. It is the x86 32-bit register EFLAGS, with a higher
32 bits added which are reserved and currently unused.

Symbol	|Bit	|Name		|Set if...
--------|-------|-------	|---------
CF	|0	|Carry		|Operation generated a carry or borrow
PF	|2	|Parity		|Last byte has even number of 1's, else 0
AF	|4	|Adjust		|Denotes Binary Coded Decimal in-byte carry
ZF	|6	|Zero		|Result was 0
SF	|7	|Sign		|Most significant bit of result is 1
OF	|11	|Overflow	|Overflow on signed operation
DF	|10	|Direction	|Direction string instructions operate (increment or decrement)
ID	|21	|Identification	|Changeability denotes presence of CPUID instruction
